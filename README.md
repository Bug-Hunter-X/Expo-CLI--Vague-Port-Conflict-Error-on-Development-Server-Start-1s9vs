# Expo CLI: Vague Port Conflict Error

This repository demonstrates a bug in Expo CLI where the development server fails to start due to a port conflict error, even when no other process is using the specified port. The error message lacks helpful information for debugging.

## Bug Report

When attempting to start the Expo development server using `expo start`, the server fails to start and displays an error message indicating a port conflict. However, no other process is using the specified port (e.g., 19000). The error message is not specific and lacks detailed information to effectively debug the issue.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the error message, which vaguely indicates a port conflict despite no other process occupying the port.

## Solution

The solution involves manually specifying a different port for the development server using the `--port` flag.  This workaround avoids the vague error.

```bash
expo start --port 19001
```

By specifying a different port, you can bypass the potential conflict.  However, a more robust solution would involve Expo CLI providing more specific error messages for better debugging.
